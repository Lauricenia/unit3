As a developer, what kind of questions would you ask your client in order to find out what you need?

Lingye: designing for musical instruments

  What is this system for?
  What is a current issue about your system right now (legacy system)? How does that annoy you?
  How comfortable do you feel with a computer or with new technologies?
  Do you currently have a system in place? What works and what doesn't?
  If anything was possible, what would you want the system to be like? 
  What doesn't work for your right now?
  What differentiates your different musical instruments?
  What device do you use most often and as such, where would you most liked the program to be housed? (your phone, laptop, etc)
  Is security important to you? 
  Purpose? (location, condition, usage, etc)
  Does your system need to be able to be easily edited? For example, do you often get new instruments?
