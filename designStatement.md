Design Statement
================

**My role as a developer:**

I am going to design an inventory to keep track of my client, Lingye Wu's, various musical instruments. The application, to be operated on a computer, will help my client to keep track of where her instruments are and who has them currently. This is important because currently, people often take her instruments and it is easy for her to lose track of where they are. Thus, I will essentialy be creating a sort of "check out" system. 

**My needs as a client:**

Currently, I have all of my clothes stored under my bed here at ISAK. However, with the residential living that we have here, my clothes sometimes can get easily lost or moved around. My clothes constantly moves between different areas on campus such as my campus, the shower room, the washing machine, drying racks, other houses, or to Asama and KAC. Because of this, it has been easy for me (especially with socks) to lose track of my clothes; over the last semester, I've noticed my clothes dwindling as some of them disappear. 

As such, I need a program which would be able to help me keep track of where my clothes is -- I would want to be able to, for example, see if my clothes was in the wash or if it was just clean and folded in my closet. I'd also want it to only be accessible by me; however, security isn't a vital aspect for me. Lastly, the main way I differentiate between my clothes is what they are (shirt, pants, shirts, etc.), their brand, and their color.
