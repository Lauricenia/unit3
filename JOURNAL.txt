Unit 3 Journal

Wednesday, January 29th: 
  Today, we had an introduction to Python. We talked about our "wish list" for a programming language which included things such as few brackets/spaces, flexible syntax, documentation/comments, functions, variables, data types, printing, logical comparisons, libraries, control structures, and more. We then talked about how to do these sorts of things in Python and talked about the following data types:
  1. Integers
  2. Lists
  3. Floats/doubles
  4. Strings
  5. Tuples
  6. Dictionary
   From there, we applied these and practiced a few programs before ending class learning about "bubble sort," an important sorting mechanism.
