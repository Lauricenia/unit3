Unit 3 Journal
==============

**Wednesday, January 29th:**

  Today, we had an introduction to Python. We talked about our "wish list" for a programming language which included things such as few brackets/spaces, flexible syntax, documentation/comments, functions, variables, data types, printing, logical comparisons, libraries, control structures, and more. We then talked about how to do these sorts of things in Python and talked about the following data types:
  1. Integers
  2. Lists
  3. Floats/doubles
  4. Strings
  5. Tuples
  6. Dictionary
   From there, we applied these and practiced a few programs before ending class learning about "bubble sort," an important sorting mechanism.
   
   
**Wednesday, February 5th:**

  We learned that this next unit will have two projects (one desktop app, one web development -- both in Python).
  1. Computational Thinking needs to be shown in the development (decomposition --> pattern recognition --> abstraction --> computational thinking) explicitly. 
  2. We did a warmup: given ten integers, find the largest prime factor. 
  3. We created a library which we will fill with important functions.
  4. My client is Lingye and my task is to create a library of musical instruments. 
  5. My PyCharm client isn't working properly so a question I have is how to fix that.
  
  
**Monday, February 10th:**

  We started with a warmup about finding the distance between various cities and through this, we learned how to extract tuples from lists. We also defined a function called distance in myLib.py.
  Following that, we established a record of tasks in order to see what steps need to be taken to create our client's program for Unit 3. Using that, we began the first step which is planning. We had an interview with our client (in my case, Lingye) and I learned about her needs (see RecordOfTasks.md).
  
  Next time, I think I need to start working on establishing what Lingye's needs are in terms of usability.
